5d2bb20c-eec1-4555-b48b-b8d5882d1dc7,"Each and every update for this app somehow makes the app worse and worse. Horrible UI changes for no reason at all and everything has started running at a snails pace since the latest update, it takes 3-5s to load anything, even something as simple as pausing a song takes 2-3s. For the past year or so I've also frequently encountered a problem where it doesn't let me play any songs, downloaded or not, with or without WiFi. I pay for music, not for you to continually make the app worse.",1

THEY MADE OFFLINE A PREMIUM FEATURE! You can now only listen to your own playlists in randomized orders. This billion dollar company has now chosen to restrict users instead of add new content. I recommend everyone leave a 1 star, delete app, and move playlists to YouTube or another app. Money hungry losers. BE THE CHANGE",1

af849889-cb63-48ef-b08d-c0bbcb83183b,For the most part is good. I would want an improvement in algorithms or whatever they're called? To know that I don't want to hear the same song more than once within a 24-hour period. I have many songs saved of certain artists and bands that I never played unless I looked for him on my lists. Why is that I don't want to hear the same song within the 24-hour period. It makes it boring. Even though I do have skip unlimited. Still you're not going to recognize the songs that are at least played.,3

It plays the same songs over and over instead of random all the time. I get it might replay once in a while, but happens more often than not. I'm more of a fan of what I choose for songs. Not a fan of suggested feature. If I go in and disable it it should stay that way, not turn back on randomly. Other than that keep up what your doing.",4

Have been a subscriber for years but recently the app started suggesting and playing podcast channels that I would not like to hear. It happens multiple times and not able to dislike or remove from my suggestion. Repeadly forcing me to hear to a podcast and not giving option to skip it.. Spotify should have option to hide podcast of special channels like other apps. bye Spotify..,1

18eac71b-ff74-4e9b-a893-3def1c6286ee,Honestly noticed a sharp decline in the apps quality within the last year. It continues to push more and more features that work poorly and aren't useful while neglecting to patch major issues with the app I've recently have had an issue with music just deciding to pause randomly. Usually within a small period of time. It is not a Internet issue it's just pausing. This has be going ok for months with no fix,3

c9f36450-9bec-4b90-829a-90f3a7b34600,1. Automatically connects to my computer when I'm listening to music on there and drains battery. WHYYY?? Literally zero purpose! 2. I get a lot more ads on my android phone than when I'm using the app on my iPad and my computer? Making it inconvenient for me to use the app for free won't make me give you money. Like at this point I use Spotify more on my computer than my phone when I'm at home now (｀□´),2

f4079f86-6925-471c-ab14-9f4ee419a39c,Maybe it's just a glitch for me but any time I put any song into a playlist it refuses to play any of the songs I've put in. This app seems fine otherwise but it's incredibly annoying when I hit the play button on one of my playlists and anything from Taylor Swift to hard rock can come up. Especially since I don't like either. I was looking forward to using this app because stupid YouTube music won't let you listen to music off platform without premium while this does.,2

b1557cd4-a3c7-4f0d-a37d-c584cc7b9329,My app is laggy beyond belief as of recently to the point it won't load my playlists it takes at least 5 minutes to play a song. I have a newer android phone even. Worst part is Spotify has no solutions to fix this. Not worth you money Edit: still sucks I shouldn't have to have my whole app glitch out cause I like alot of music and want to shuffle it . You keep raising the price and I'm ready to stop paying cause I have no convience. If it let me give 0 stars I would! Spotify use to be better,1

What I dont love is that I pay for no advertisements, and yet the individual podcasts are permitted to have their own. They should have to provide spotify with an edited, none advertised version. I get that they make money that way, but I am paying so that I dont have commercials, and yet I have commercials. Seems dishonest.",4

I keeping downloading music in premium, but skipping songs, limit to lyrics, not able to play a song from a favourite part of that particular song, songs not playing in order was a buzzkill. The only reason I am giving Spotify a 5 star is it was the best app to listen to music when it was free and even now when it is paid. I hope to see some updates in th free version.",5

1fd42252-4e32-494f-832c-078dcf45b970,This app has made it so you have 6 skips an hour yes you heard me only 6 and if your away for 2 weeks you only get to listen for that long before you can't listen internationaly anymore without premium because you need premium to download a playlist and if you created a new playlist it will recommend songs and sometimes play them without them being on your playlist. So in reality your better of getting apple music. Don't bother with Spotify anymore,2

c4d45a36-d72e-4bed-b9af-e31db3fff681,It's a very bad app. If you don't have premium you can't even listen to your favorite music. If you get Premium then only you can listen your choice songs otherwise it will play any kind of song and even if you go to change that song a message will appear saying get Premium first. Like seriously if someone don't want to buy Premium then it's their choice right. Really disappointed with this app. You cannot listen your choice songs if you don't have Premium. So it's better to not use this app.,1

Playlists and songs keep shifting when I try to tap, causing other things to load or play. There are new ads and questionnaires for concert goers and there's no way to opt out.

8f7d9cfa-7348-442a-92de-d1ea75aa0c65,I love this app and I use it every day but they take premium to far if you want to listen to a specific song you need premium and that kinda defeats the point of the search. If your rich and want to pay for music you can listen to on YouTube then sure but I honestly think its a waste of time and money. most of the reviews are really bad unless the people are paying for premium. Im still gonna continue to use it because I have 1330 songs liked at the moment. But honestly I wouldn't download it.,3

Even in areas of good 5G service songs randomly cut out or get choppy or the app stops working all together. My other issue is with the ads. Why give the option to up vote or down vote an add to improve my experience when it has no effect on the types of ads I hear?

99d97c8b-f61e-4c80-8a9e-0ad0bf94a9d8,I have the premium version and I generally like Spotify as it has most of the music I want. The search facility is good and once you get used to the UI (which is quite complex) you can set up your library. One thing I would find useful which it doesn't have is a way of batch adding to a playlist from Liked songs; having to do it one at a time is tedious. Spotify is expensive at £12 per month compared to others like YouTube Music. And the App doesn't work well on Sky Q for some reason.,4

I shouldn't have to opt out everytime. Other issue is the price keeps going up, but quality stays the same. Starting to wish I had an iPhone for Apple music :/",4

Idk if it's just me, but before when you liked a song and went to song radio, it would give you songs similar to it. I know there's daylist now, but it doesn't hit the same 😔",2

2b5b19cf-755d-450a-ab4a-832d0d217998,This used to be the best music app until it decided it wanted to be Pandora. Spotify benefit was making playlists so you could listen to the music you wanted to hear but now Spotify just starts adding songs into your rotation (even if listening to only liked songs) so you have to waste your 6 skips on music your not even trying to hear 🤦🏼‍♂️. Back to Pandora... Their new features is giving more control over your music options,2

It's a music app, but you need premium to listen to a specific song, you need premium to rewind songs and you need premium to LOOK AT LYRICS. There's more ads than songs and they're all unskippable. They make billions of dollars a month ans are still desperate for more money. Just use youtube music, it may have ads buy at least you can pick the song.",1

I now have another card and I only have $30 dollars for it and it's still not showing me where to put this card number sequence in it at I have never seen an app that didn't have a place on it's site to put stuff like that down. I'm out of $90 dollars now your number #¹ fan.,5

(Crazy, I know.) Just thought your team of several adults might need some help with that complicated math. That or you can fix your app, trust me, I could write a ten paragraph essay about this god forsaken app. Thanks! 💚",1

It also even when you pay for a premium not at service they still push ads on you between podcast episodes and music changes. I thought the purpose of a subscription was so I didn't get inundated with any ads and have the freedom to play the music in the order I select and other smaller options! Borderline ridiculous that $10 a month gets you adds to any degree!,3

The only way to shut this off is to get premium, which sucks. 2. Ads - Fake Promises Whenever you hear the message: After this ad, you'll listen uninterrupted for 30 minutes.

It feels like ""smart shuffle"" gets more invasive every update. The fact there isn't a toggle to permanently remove the feature baffles me after over a year of it being listed BY SPOTIFY as a ""good suggestion"" on their suggestions forum. Smart shuffle adds songs you don't want into playlists, and when you're specifically curating a playlist to be perfect it ruins it and turns itself on. STOP",3

Add a sub-option to the mix option on the artist's home page to mix the entire discography (currently a reduced number of songs are mixed). 3.

It keeps trying to bomb me with K-pop, R&B, country and, pop music when I have ZERO of that in my library. The infuriating feature of this app is that shuffle does not actually shuffle the playlist, instead it prioritizes the songs you play the most.

Songs that you search up don't play immediately, it plays related songs instead, forcing you to use your limited skips to get to the song you actually wanted to hear. Sometimes the song you wanted doesn't even come up at all. Not to mention that the ""watch an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is a sham. It just plays another ad right after.

I agree with other users that I don't particularly like the playing of 'recommended tracks' that are not in my playlist. It should either stop or loop. Remove this and it's 5*",4
